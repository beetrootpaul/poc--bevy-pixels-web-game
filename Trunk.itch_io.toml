# By default, `trunk` generates absolute path links to resources.
#   Sadly, they do not work on itch.io, because the game is served
#   from the subdirectory there. Therefore, we need to replace those
#   links with relative ones. Moreover, we cannot use `--public-url "./"`
#   CLI argument, because it worksâ€¦ differently (results with `/./` paths).
